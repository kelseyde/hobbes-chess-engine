# <div align="center"> Hobbes </div>

Hobbes is a work-in-progress chess engine written in Rust.

It is the sequel to my other chess engine, [Calvin](https://github.com/kelseyde/calvin-chess-engine).

My motivations for starting a new chess engine are threefold:

1. To learn Rust. I'm a Java developer by trade, but I wanted to experiment with a more performant systems programming language, and Rust is very popular in the chess engine programming community.
2. To learn about neural networks + machine learning. Hobbes will be an NNUE-based engine trained from zero-knowledge, on games generated entirely by self-play.
3. To re-unite Calvin with his favourite playmate :slightly_smiling_face:

</div>

A strong chess engine written in Rust, with NNUE evaluation trained from zero knowledge, using self-generated training data.

Hobbes is a rewrite of my Java chess engine, [Calvin](https://github.com/kelseyde/calvin-chess-engine). Hobbes is also a collaborative effort from the members of [mattbench](https://chess.n9x.co/index/), who have each contributed hardware (and patches) towards turning Hobbes into a strong engine. 

## Strength

Hobbes is not yet officially released. The current strength is approximately 3640 elo CCRL blitz.
